                <div>
                    <h3>1. Take a seat</h3>
                        <p>Find place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.</p>
                    <h3>2. Set a time limit</h3>
                        <p>If you're just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.</p>
                    <h3>3. Notice your body</h3>
                        <p>You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneel-all are fine. 
                        Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.</p>
                    <h3>4. Feel your breath</h3>
                        <p>Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.</p>
                    <h3>5. Notice when your mind has wandered</h3>
                        <p>Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing that 
                        your mind has wandered-in a few seconds, a minute, five minutes-simply return your attention to the breath.</p>
                    <h3>6. Be kind to your wandering mind</h3>
                        <p>Don't judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come back.</p>
                    <h3>7. Close with kindness</h3>
                        <p>When you're ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds 
                        in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.</p>

                <h2>Other Meditation Techniques</h2>
                <p>There are other meditation techniques that use different focal points than the breath to anchor our attention-external 
                    objects like a sound in the room, or something broader, such as noticing spontaneous things that come into your awareness 
                    during an aimless wandering practice. But all of these practices have one thing in common: We notice that our minds ARE running 
                    the show a lot of the time. It's true. We think thoughts, typically, and then we act.</p>

                    <h2>1. Mindfulness Meditation</h2>
                    <p>Mindfulness meditation is the process of being fully present with your awareness. Being mindful means being aware of where 
                        we are and what we're doing, and not being overly reactive to what's going on around us. <br><br>
                        Mindful meditation can be done anywhere. Some people prefer to sit in a quiet place, close their eyes, and focus on 
                        their breathing. But you can choose to be mindful at any point of the day, including while you're commuting to work or doing chores.
                        When practicing mindfulness meditation, you observe your thoughts and emotions but let them pass without judgement.</p>

                    <h2>2. Transcendental Meditation</h2>
                    <p>Transcendental meditation may sound lofty, but it's actually a basic technique: You choose a mantra - a word, a phrase, 
                        or a sound - and repeat it for 20 minutes twice a day. It's best to do this seated, with your eyes closed. <br><br>
                        Meditating this way helps your body and mind to fully relax, so that you can feel a sense of peace and calm</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>3. Guided Meditation</h2>
                    <p>Guided meditation, which is sometimes also called guided imagery or visualization, is a method of meditation in 
                        which you form mental pictures or situations that you find relaxing. <br><br>
                        This process is typically led by a guide or teacher, hence “guided.” It's often suggested to use as many senses as possible, 
                        such as smell, sounds, and textures, to evoke calmness in your relaxing space.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>4. Loving Kindness Meditation</h2>
                    <p>Metta meditation, also called loving kindness meditation, is the practice of directing well-wishes toward others. You recite specific 
                        words and phrases meant to evoke warm-hearted feelings. It's typically practiced while sitting in a comfortable, relaxed position. 
                        After a few deep breaths, you repeat words slowly and steadily. <br><br>
                        These could include: 
                        “May I be happy. May I be well. May I be safe. May I be peaceful and at ease.”<br><br>
                        After a period of directing this loving kindness toward yourself, you may begin to picture a family member or friend who has helped you 
                        and repeat the mantra again, this time replacing “I” with “you.” <br><br>
                        As you continue the meditation, you can bring other members of your family, friends, neighbors, or people in your life to mind. 
                        Practitioners are also encouraged to visualize people they have difficulty with. <br><br>
                        Finally, you end the meditation with the universal mantra: “May all beings everywhere be happy.”</p>

                    <h2>5. Yoga Meditation</h2>
                    <p>The practice of yoga dates back to ancient India. There are a wide variety of classes and styles of yoga, but they all involve 
                        performing a series of postures and controlled breathing exercises meant to promote flexibility and calm the mind. The poses 
                        require balance and concentration and you are encouraged to focus less on distractions and stay more in the moment.</p>
